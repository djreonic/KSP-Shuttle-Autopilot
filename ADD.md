# Architecture Design Document

## Introduction
This document outlines the architectural design of the KSP Shuttle Autopilot project.

## Purpose
To provide a structured view of the system architecture, including components, relationships, and technologies used.

## Components
- **Auto-Pilot Module**: Manages the main functionalities of the shuttle autopilot system.
- **Navigation System**: Calculates the optimal path and trajectory.
- **Control System**: Interfaces with shuttle hardware for control actions.
- **User Interface**: Front-end application for user interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask (for the web interface)
- **Databases**: SQLite or PostgreSQL (for storing configurations)

## Conclusion
This document will be updated as the project evolves to reflect any changes in architecture or technologies used.
